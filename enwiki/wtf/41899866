In the meeting with the prime minister of Moldova, PM Šimonytė of Lithuania expressed support for the reforms undertaken by the Moldovan Government and its aspiration to move closer towards the EU. Šimonytė also emphasised that the implementation of the EU-Moldova Association Agreement, including its part on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, also contributes to these ambitious goals. The counterparts discussed areas where Lithuania could step up its support for Moldova through shared expertise and closer inter-institutional cooperation, namely energy, reforming of justice and home affairs, anti-corruption, the environment, and others. During the visit, the Lithuanian and Moldovan Deputy Foreign Ministers signed a memorandum of understanding on strengthening Moldova’s institutional capacity and governance. Lithuania will provide 350 thousand euros for the implementation of this memorandum. In the meeting with President of Moldova Maia Sandu, prime minister Šimonytė talked over the reforms, the regional security, co-operation with the EU, and the prospects of the Eastern Partnership policy in the context of the forthcoming Eastern Partnership Summit. The Prime Minister of Lithuania welcomed Moldova’s ambitious attitude as regards the future of this policy, while encouraging to continue the joint efforts between Moldova, Ukraine and Sakartvelo towards closer dialogue with the EU. In her meeting with Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament Igor Grosu, the prime minister of Lithuania once again thanked the Moldovan Parliament for having been the first to recognise the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania 30 years ago. Šimonytė pointed out the importance of parliamentary diplomacy in gaining international support for Moldova’s reform processes. Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė also participated in discussion with Lithuanian experts working in Moldova and together with the Prime Minister of Moldova opened an honorary consulate of the Republic of Lithuania.",

PM Šimonytė of Lithuania expressed hope that this decision will be long-lasting and underlined that through solidarity shown in this respect, together they will undermine Belarusian regime's schemes to profit from the unsafe NPP, and will also bring down Russia's influence in the region.",

PM Šimonytė has noted the deteriorating situation, which calls for urgent decisions at both national and EU level and stressed that in the last two days alone, almost half a thousand irregular migrants had crossed the border. It was agreed at the meeting that joint efforts should first and foremost focus on reducing migratory flows, returning irregular migrants to their countries of origin, and urging Iraq to comply with its international obligations. Also prime minister of Lithuania noted that Lithuania is bearing a significant financial burden. Hence possibilities of financial assistance from the European Commission, including technical assistance in installing border surveillance and control systems, were discussed at the meeting with Commissioner Johansson. According to Šimonytė, Lithuania is doing its utmost to ensure that irregular migrants are promptly detained and that no new transit route is created. The necessary legislative changes have been adopted to allow all planned asylum procedures to be carried out without delay. The meeting emphasised the need to prevent human trafficking, dismantle irregular migration networks, and deter migrants from attempting to cross the EU's external border illegally. Furthermore PM Šimonytė emphasised that the Government does not see any alternative to creating a physical barrier.",
