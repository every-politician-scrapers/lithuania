PM Šimonytė has noted the deteriorating situation, which calls for urgent decisions at both national and EU level and has stressed that in the last two days alone, almost half a thousand irregular migrants had crossed the border. It has been agreed at the meeting that joint efforts should first and foremost focus on reducing migratory flows, returning irregular migrants to their countries of origin, and urging Iraq to comply with its international obligations. Also Prime Minister of Lithuania has noted that Lithuania is bearing a significant financial burden. Hence possibilities of financial assistance from the European Commission, including technical assistance in installing border surveillance and control systems, have been discussed at the meeting with Commissioner Johansson. According to Šimonytė, Lithuania is doing its utmost to ensure that irregular migrants are promptly detained and that no new transit route is created. The necessary legislative changes have been adopted to allow all planned asylum procedures to be carried out without delay. The meeting has emphasised the need to prevent human trafficking, dismantle irregular migration networks, and deter migrants from attempting to cross the EU's external border illegally. Furthermore PM Šimonytė has emphasised that the Government does not see any alternative to creating a physical barrier.",
